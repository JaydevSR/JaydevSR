<h1 align="center">👋 Hello! I am Jaydev!</h1>

<br>

🎓 I studied EECS (B.S.) at IISER Bhopal from 2019-23, then Physics (MASt) at Cambridge in 2023-24.

❤️ I love all sorts of physics but I am most attracted towards to physics of intermediate scales (not too big, not too small).
    ↳ I am also passinate about computer science and writing code to do cool stuff (I am sure you know what cool stuff I mean if you're here *wink*)

📖 Right now I am preparing myself for an academic career as a Physicist.
    ↳ So, my day revolves around the usual stuff: PhD related things, reading papers, research projects etc.

🎵 As for my hobbies, I am really into Indian classical music and learning new languages.
    ↳ I also like to whittling, reading and sketching in between.
    
🤝 If you want to talk to me about anything then feel free to reach out to me on the email given below.
    ↳ I am usually very quick to reply 😉
