<h1 align="center">👋 Hello! I am Jaydev!</h1>

<br>

🎓 I am an Undergraduate Student majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at [IISER Bhopal](https://iiserb.ac.in).

❤️ I love studying physics and working on computational problems. I mostly use Julia as a tool for that.

🎥 Things I like to do when I am not working: Practice flute, read or sleep.
