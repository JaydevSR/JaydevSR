<h1 align="center">👋 Hello! I am Jaydev!</h1>

<br>

🎓 I am an undergraduate student majoring in EECS at [IISER Bhopal](https://iiserb.ac.in).

❤️ I love studying physics and computer science and enjoy working on computational problems in statistical physics.
    ↳ Julia is a tool of choice for me.

💻 Right now I am trying to contribute to [Molly.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/Molly.jl) as a GSoC student.
    ↳ Other than that I am also involved in research on spin models and their applications using Monte-Carlo simulations.

🎵 I am also really into Indian classical music and learning to play the bamboo flute in my free time.
