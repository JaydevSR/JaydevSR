<h1 align="center">👋 Hello! I am Jaydev!</h1>

<br>

🎓 Currently, I am a PhD student in the group of Prof. Alessio Lerose at the Institute for theoretical physics at KU Leuven.
    ↳ I studied EECS (B.S.) at IISER Bhopal from 2019-23, then Physics (MASt) at Cambridge in 2023-24.

❤️ I love all sorts of physics but I am most attracted towards to physics of intermediate scales (not too big, not too small).
    ↳ I am also passinate about computer science and writing code to do cool stuff (I am sure you know what cool stuff I mean if you're here *wink*)

📖 Right now I am involved in some serious research so better not disturb me, lol just kidding.
    ↳ My day revolves around the usual stuff: PhD related things, reading papers and tackling research problems head on (seriously it hurts sometimes: I am not a rhino!)

🎵 As for my hobbies, I am really into Indian classical music and learning new languages.
    ↳ I also like to whittling and sketching in between.
    
🤝 If you want to talk to me about anything then feel free to reach out to me on the email given below.
    ↳ I am usually very quick to reply 😉
