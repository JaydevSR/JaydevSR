<h1 align="center">👋 Hello! I am Jaydev!</h1>

<br>

🎓 I graduated from [IISER Bhopal](https://iiserb.ac.in) with a BS in EECS in the year 2023.

❤️ I love studying physics and computer science and enjoy working on computational problems.
    ↳ I especially love problems which <emph>I</emph> can probably never solve without a computer.
    ↳ Julia is the tool of choice for me.

📖 Right now I am trying to deal with my undergraduate courses.
    ↳ I am also involved in research on spin models and their applications using Monte-Carlo simulations. 
    ↳ Other than that I am trying to contribute to open-source projects in Julia.

🎵 As for my hobbies, I am really into Indian classical music and learning to play the bamboo flute in my free time.
    
🤝 If you want to talk to me about anything then feel free to reach out to me on the email given below.
    ↳ I am usually very quick to reply 😉
